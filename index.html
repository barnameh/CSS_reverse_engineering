  <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
  </p>
  <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
    </p>
    <p class="sonnet_lines">
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
